# customapi

Just a silly CustomAPI project making use of Clojure specific libraries to build a service layered backend that aims to be as similar as possible (both in architecture and experience) to FastAPI.

## Installation

  *  Check `java` is installed with `java -version` (`openjdk version "21.0.5"`)
  *  Check `lein` is installed with `lein -version` (`Leiningen 2.11.2 on Java 21.0.5 OpenJDK`)
  *  Run `lein deps` to install all required dependencies listed in `project.clj`
  *  Run `lein run` to start server at `localhost:3000` by default

## Usage

  *  Check `docker` is installed with `docker -version` (`Docker version 27.5.1`)
  *  Run `lein uberjar` to compile project and get a `/target/uberjar/server.jar` file
  *  Build a dev docker image for it with `docker build -f dev.Dockerfile -t customapi .`
  *  Run the docker container afer building its image with `docker run -p 3000:3000 customapi`
  *  Pass secrets to the starting container via `docker run -p 4000:4000 -e PORT=4000 ... customapi`
  *  Start server and db in docker-compose with default vars with `docker-compose -f docker-compose.dev.yml up`

## Options

  *  `lein run`: Start the server on default settings
  *  `lein deps`: Check project dependencies and install them
  *  `lein clean`: Clean dependencies libraries and cache
  *  `lein lint`: Spot `clojure` code from linting issues
  *  `lein lint-fix`: Fix `clojure` code from linting issues
  *  `lein test`: Run whole project unit and integration tests
  *  `lein test :only ns`: Run an specific test passing its namespace
  *  `lein unit`: Run only unit tests, located at `test/customapi/unit`
  *  `lein integration`: Run only integration tests, located at `test/customapi/integration`
  *  `lein uberjar`: Compile project into a portable `.jar` file

## Features

  *  Logger: Making use of `slf4j` logs and just for specified ones via `/resources/logback.xml`
  *  Migrations: Automatically set database tables and connection via `/src/customapi/db/core.clj` 
  *  Middlewares: Fully integrated pickeable middlewares via `/src/customapi/config/middlewares.clj`
  *  Modularity: Segregation of layers; customizable and sustainable folders organization
  *  Secrets: Dynamically pass env secrets and as in EDN config as well via `config/secrets.clj`
  *  Config: Config Load environment variables too, automatically from `/config.edn`
  *  Variables: Set the environment and its variables via CLI as in `ENV=test PORT=4000 ... lein run`
  *  Production: Use those for the production build as well via `ENV=prod PORT=4000 ... java -jar target/uberjar/customapi.jar`
  *  JWT: Encrypt JSONs in tokens and then decrypt them for authentication via `/src/customapi/config/jwt.clj`
  *  OAuth: Middleware for secured API endpoints with interactive `auth-header` via `/src/customapi/config/middlewares.clj`
  *  OpenAPI: Self-documenting and interacteable API endpoints at `localhost:3000/index.html`
  *  RestAPI: Resftul API endpoints fulfilling CRUD operations for a `/src/customapi/schemas/clothes.clj` schema
  *  Tests: Validate `schemas` with unit tests and `routes` with integration tests in `/test/customapi` respectively
  *  Test env: Integration tests that connect to the DB take place within `test.db` via `ENV=test lein integration`
  *  Test aux: Common funcs and DB fixtures for both unit and integration tests at `/test/customapi/aux`
